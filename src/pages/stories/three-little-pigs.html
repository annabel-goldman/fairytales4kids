<article><p>Once upon a time, there lived three little pigs. Their mother loved them very much, but one day she told them they were old enough to build their own homes and live on their own.</p><p>The first little pig wanted to play instead of work. He quickly built his house out of straw because it was easy and fast.</p><p>The second little pig worked a little harder than his brother. He built his house out of sticks. It was stronger than straw, but still not very strong.</p><p>The third little pig worked very hard all day long. He built his house out of bricks, making sure each brick was placed perfectly. His house was strong and had a big fireplace with a chimney.</p><p>Soon, a hungry wolf came walking down the road. He saw the first pig's straw house and smelled the pig inside. The wolf's mouth began to water.</p><p>"Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" called the wolf.</p><p>The first pig looked through his window and saw the wolf's big paws. "No, no, no! Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!"</p><p>"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" said the wolf.</p><p>The wolf took a deep breath and blew the straw house down with one big puff. But the first pig ran as fast as he could to his brother's stick house.</p><p>The wolf followed the pig and found the stick house with both pigs inside. His stomach growled loudly.</p><p>"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!" he called.</p><p>The two pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears and said together, "No, no, no! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!"</p><p>"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" growled the wolf.</p><p>The wolf huffed and puffed and blew the stick house down. Both pigs ran quickly to their brother's brick house and slammed the door.</p><p>The angry wolf came to the brick house. He could smell all three pigs inside, and he was very hungry.</p><p>"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!" he demanded.</p><p>The three pigs looked at the wolf's mean eyes and shouted, "No, no, no! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!"</p><p>"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" roared the wolf.</p><p>The wolf huffed and puffed until his face turned red, but the brick house did not move. The tired wolf sat down to think of another plan.</p><p>Finally, the wolf decided to climb on the roof and come down the chimney. "I'll get you now, little pigs!" he called.</p><p>But the smart third pig heard the wolf on the roof. He quickly put a big pot of water on the fire to boil. When the wolf came down the chimney, he fell right into the hot water!</p><p>The wolf jumped out and ran away as fast as he could, and he never bothered the three little pigs again. The pigs learned that hard work and planning ahead can keep you safe. They lived happily together in the strong brick house.</p></article>
