<p>Once upon a time, in a kingdom far away, a beautiful princess was born. Her parents named her Aurora. They were so happy to have her that they organized a grand christening ceremony. Everybody was invited, including the fairies, who were all to become godmothers to the Princess.</p>
<p>However, they forgot to invite one old fairy. Out of anger, the old fairy cursed the young Princess. The curse stated that Aurora would prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. One of the young fairies, who hadn't presented her gift yet, said she wouldn't die but sleep until a prince awakens her with a kiss.</p>
<p>One day, when Aurora turned sixteen, she discovered a tower where an old woman was spinning. Out of curiosity, she touched the spindle and immediately fell into a deep sleep. The entire kingdom was put to sleep along with her.</p>
<p>Many years went by, and one day, a prince arrived, who had heard stories about a sleeping beauty. He went into the tower and found Aurora. He kissed her, and she woke up, followed by everyone else in the kingdom. They celebrated their awakening, and the Prince and Aurora lived happily ever after.</p>
