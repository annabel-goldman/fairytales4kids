<p>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.</p>
<p>He was not just an ordinary egg, oh no! He was an egg with a spirit, full of adventure. This made him climb that tall, towering wall.</p>
<p>But as you know, the wall was awfully high, and it made Humpty feel like he could touch the sky. So up he went without a care, the higher he got, the more he could stare.</p>
<p>However, in his excitement, dear Mr. Dumpty forgot that he was nothing more than a fragile egg. Unlucky for him, he stumbled and lost his balance, resulting in a great fall.</p>
<p>All the king's horses and all the king's men rushed to the spot. They tried their best, but, alas, they couldn't put Humpty together again.</p>
<p>So, children, this tale reminds all to be careful when we play, for we wouldn't want an adventurous day to end in dismay.</p>
