<article><p>Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a sweet girl named Rose Red. She got her name because her mother's garden was filled with beautiful red roses that matched the rosy color of her cheeks. Rose Red had a kind heart and was always ready to help others.</p><p>Rose Red had a special gift that made her childhood magical. She could talk to all the animals in the forest. Birds would sing songs with her, squirrels would play games, and even the busy ants would stop to chat. Rose Red spent many happy afternoons in the forest with her animal friends.</p><p>One cold winter day, a large bear came to their door. He was shivering and looked very cold. Even though bears can be scary, Rose Red saw that this bear was gentle and kind.</p><p>"Don't be afraid, dear bear," Rose Red said with a warm smile. "Come inside where it's warm. You can stay with us until winter is over."</p><p>The bear was so grateful for Rose Red's kindness. He stayed with the family all winter long, sleeping by the fire and becoming their friend. Rose Red would brush his fur and tell him stories.</p><p>When spring came, the bear knew it was time to leave. But before he went, he had something important to tell Rose Red.</p><p>"Rose Red," he said, "I am not really a bear. I am a prince who was cursed by a wicked witch. Because you were so kind to me, the curse is now broken."</p><p>Right before Rose Red's eyes, the bear transformed into a handsome prince! He was so thankful for her kindness that he asked her to come live in his kingdom as his princess.</p><p>Rose Red was amazed and excited. She said yes, and they traveled to his beautiful kingdom together. There, Rose Red continued to spread kindness and love to everyone she met, just as she had done in her little village. She and the prince lived happily ever after, and their kingdom was filled with joy and laughter.</p></article>
