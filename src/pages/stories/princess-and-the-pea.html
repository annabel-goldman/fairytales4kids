<article><p>Once upon a time, there was a prince who wanted to marry a real princess. He traveled all around the world looking for one, but he could never be sure if the ladies he met were truly princesses or just pretending.</p><p>One stormy night, rain poured down and thunder crashed. Suddenly, someone knocked on the castle door. When the servants opened it, they found a young woman standing in the rain. She was soaking wet, but she said she was a real princess.</p><p>The queen had an idea to test if she was telling the truth. She went to the guest bedroom and placed a tiny pea under the mattress. Then she piled twenty soft mattresses and twenty feather beds on top of it, making the bed very, very tall.</p><p>"You can sleep here tonight," the queen told the young woman, showing her to the enormous bed.</p><p>The next morning, the queen asked the young woman how she had slept.</p><p>"Oh, terribly!" said the young woman. "I barely slept at all. There was something hard in the bed that kept me awake all night. I'm covered in bruises!"</p><p>The prince and queen looked at each other and smiled. They knew right away that she must be a real princess! Only a true princess could be so sensitive that she could feel a tiny pea through twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds.</p><p>The prince was so happy to finally find a real princess. He asked her to marry him, and she said yes. They had a beautiful wedding and lived happily ever after.</p><p>As for the pea that proved she was a real princess, they put it in the royal museum where everyone could see it. And if no one has taken it away, it's probably still there today!</p></article>
