<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack who lived with his mother. They were very poor and had just a cow for their livelihood.</p>
<p>One day, Jack's mother told him to sell the cow. On his way to market, he met a strange man who offered him magic beans in exchange for the cow, and Jack made the trade. When he returned home and showed the beans to his mother, she was so angry that she tossed them out the window.</p>
<p>The next morning, Jack woke up to see a giant beanstalk had grown from the magic beans. He decided to climb it, and he climbed up to the sky until he found a massive castle.</p>
<p>In that castle lived a giant and his wife. Jack hid when he saw the giant and heard him say, "Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman!". Jack managed to escape from the Castle with the giant's hen that laid golden eggs. When the giant followed him down, Jack cut down the beanstalk. The giant fell and that was the end of him.</p>
<p>With the golden eggs, Jack and his mother lived happily ever after.</p>
