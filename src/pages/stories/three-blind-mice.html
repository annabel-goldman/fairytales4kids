<article><p>Three blind mice, three blind mice,<br>See how they run, see how they run!</p><p>Once upon a time, there were three little mice who couldn't see. But even though they were blind, these three mice were very special friends who looked out for each other.</p><p>The three blind mice lived in a cozy hole near a warm bakery. Every morning, they would wake up to the wonderful smell of fresh bread and cookies baking. Their noses were very good at telling them about the world around them.</p><p>"Do you smell that?" said the first mouse, sniffing the air. "The baker is making chocolate chip cookies today!"</p><p>"And cinnamon rolls!" added the second mouse, his little nose twitching with excitement.</p><p>"Let's go explore!" said the third mouse, who was always ready for an adventure.</p><p>So the three friends set off together, holding each other's tails so they wouldn't get lost. They used their excellent hearing and wonderful sense of smell to find their way around.</p><p>They ran through the kitchen, following the delicious smells. But oh no! The farmer's wife saw them and chased them with a wooden spoon!</p><p>"Run!" squeaked the mice, and they scurried as fast as their little legs could carry them. They ran and ran until they were safely back home in their cozy hole.</p><p>Even though they couldn't see, the three blind mice were very brave and clever. They showed that with good friends by your side, you can have wonderful adventures and always find your way home.</p><p>And from that day on, whenever children heard their story, they would sing: "Three blind mice, three blind mice, see how they run, see how they run!"</p></article>
