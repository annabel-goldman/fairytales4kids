<article><p>Once upon a time, a humble woodcutter lived in a creaky old cottage, shrouded on the outskirts of a dense forest. His wife, a stern stepmother to his two beloved children, Hansel and Gretel, shared their meager dwelling. Poverty lurked in every corner of their home, manifesting as patched clothes and thin, hollow faces. Stealing a glance at her emaciated family one bleak day, the wicked stepmother, with gaunt cheeks and a heart to match, seized the reins of desperation. She manipulated the reluctant woodcutter into abandoning Hansel and Gretel deep within the whispering forest, unable to feed them any further due to their wretched poverty.</p><p>Overhearing the stepmother's fiendish plan, quick-witted Hansel devised a clever counter-plot. Under the cloak of the night, he filled his threadbare pockets with shimmering white pebbles. As their parents led them sinisterly into the forest the following day, his small, trembling hand let loose a trail of pebbles. As the silhouette of the woodcutter and his wife dwindled, their deceit unveiled itself. Yet fear did not chain them; they traced their path back to the familiar warmth of their humble cottage, guided by moonlit pebbles.</p><p>Despite the earlier setback, the stepmother courageously hatched another plan the next day. Bravely pretending to be resigned, Hansel now only had breadcrumbs, he left a breadcrumb trail to mark their way. As night fell, they hoped to retreat along this line of approximately placed crumbs, but alas, the wily forest birds fluttered down, pecking each crumb away. Despair and fear gripped the children as they realised they had no way back this time; they were truly lost amid the towering, indifferent trees.</p><p>Exhausted and ravenous, they wandered the eerie labyrinth of the woods for days. Just when hope was about to surrender, they stumbled upon an enchanting sight - an eccentric house constructed entirely of delectable candies and mouthwatering sweets. Their starved souls propelled them towards the tempting candy structure. As they chipped away and savoured pieces of candy bricks and icing windows, the creaky front door revealed, a seemingly benign old woman. Her rheumy eyes twinkling, she feigned kindness, inviting the unsuspecting siblings into her candy haven.</p><p>Little did they know that the deceptive old lady was a bloodthirsty witch with a wicked hankering for child flesh. Her delectable candy home was nothing but a macabre trap for wandering, innocent children. Hansel was imprisoned in a grimy cage, his heart pounding like a trapped bird, while Gretel was reduced to a scrawny, unwilling servant, exploited to maintain the witch's grotesque lifestyle, while the wicked witch salivated at thoughts of roasting chubby Hansel.</p><p>One fateful day, the witch commanded Gretel to check the oven's wrathful heat in preparation for Hansel's grim fate. Seeing a sliver of opportunity, Gretel feigned cluelessness, saying, "I...I don't understand, can you demonstrate how I check it?" As the witch hunched over the oven, Gretel mustered up her scant courage, hands trembling, heart thundering, and with a sharp push, shoved the grotesque figure into the fiery jaws of the oven. The door slammed shut with a monstrous clang.</p><p>Exhaling relief, the children discovered a hidden treasure trove in the witch's house. Laden with sparkling jewels and gleaming coins, their little pockets bulged as they looted the wealth. Dashing through the labyrinthine forest, filled with resurrected hope, they returned home. At home a sorrowful revelation awaited: their stepmother has passed away, and the sight of their gaunt but warm-hearted father stirred up a whirlwind of emotions. Overcome with unexpected joy, he embraced his precious children who returned not only alive but bearing the promise of opulence. With the witch's treasure, they never feared the chains of poverty again; the echoes of laughter and happiness forever filled their humble cottage.</p></article>
