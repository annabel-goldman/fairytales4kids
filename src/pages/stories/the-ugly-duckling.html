<article><p>Once upon a radiant morning, tucked within a charming farmyard flanked by weeping willows and emerald green meadows, a little creature of drooping spirit dwelled. This hapless waterfowl was not esteemed by his siblings or even his mother, for his appearance was strikingly peculiar. He bore an elongated neck and cumbersome wings unlike his siblings. His different physique made him the pariah within his own family, causing him heart-wrenching despair.</p><p>"What's wrong with me? Why do they not love me? Am I really that unusual?" the little bird often wondered, his heart heavy with wistful yearning. The other ducklings teased him daily, cackling in jest, "You're a strange one! You're no duckling, you're just an ugly misfit!"</p><p>Months gradually slipped by like sand from a clenched fist, the small, innocent creature could take no more, thus, with his heart laden with sorrow, he took flight from the farmyard. With tear-brimmed eyes, he found refuge by a sprawling lake, where he resolved to survive despite the relentless frost and biting winds of winter. His lonesome existence was only amplified by the cold, almost unbearable, winters. Nevertheless, he endured, fueled by an inner will to thrive against all odds.</p><p>With the arrival of Spring, a blanket of vibrant hues and floral scents draped the landscape. Our once forlorn 'ugly duckling,' now a full-grown bird was contemplating his bleak prospect. His heart pounded with a searing fear of the potential hatred he was willing to face again, but he had made up his mind, "If they still despise me... I have but no choice. It's better to face this than live in isolation... let it be!" With this thought, he edged towards the water, plunging himself in, and noticed something extraordinary. Staring at his reflection, he gasped in disbelief at the image staring back.</p><p>"I... I am not an ugly duckling! I am a swan! It has always been this way!" he stammered out, processing his sudden comprehension. His heart was filled with an overpowering emotion, realising the reason behind his contrasting looks - he was never meant to be a passing poor mimicry of a duckling; he was born a swan, destined for grace and beauty, even if it meant growing up in a duck's world.</p><p>Joy radiated from him, warmer than the sun above. His initial shock was soon replaced with boisterous joy, "I am a swan! I am a beautiful swan!" he exclaimed reverberating across the mirrored lake. From that moment forth, our hero lived his life with grandeur, no longer a misfit but a celebrated individual of innate elegance. His family, upon realizing his transformation, swiftly replaced their disdain with respect. In the end, he found that it was all worth it. His past struggles, his desperate attempts for acceptance paved the road for this triumph, and he indeed lived happily ever after.</p></article>
