<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She was a curious and adventurous child who loved to explore the world around her.</p>
<p>One day, while walking in the forest, she came across a charming little house. The house belonged to a family of bears: Mama Bear, Papa Bear, and Baby Bear. Unbeknownst to Goldilocks, the bears had gone out for a walk while their breakfast cooled down.</p>
<p>Goldilocks entered the house and found three bowls of porridge set on the table. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl, "This porridge is too hot!" she exclaimed. She tasted the porridge from the second bowl, "This porridge is too cold," she said. Finally, she tasted the last bowl of porridge, and it was just right, so she ate it all up.</p>
<p>After eating, she felt tired and found three chairs set in the room. She tried sitting on the first chair. "This chair is too big!" she squawked. She tried the second chair, "This chair is also too big!" she whined. Then she sat on the smallest chair and sighed, "This chair is just right, it's perfect for me!" However, to Goldilocks's surprise, the chair collapsed under her weight.</p>
<p>Exhausted from her events, she went upstairs. Here she found three beds. She tried the first one but it was too hard, the second one was too soft, but the third one was perfect. Goldilocks quickly fell asleep.</p>
<p>When the bears returned, they were shocked to find someone had been at their house. With Goldilocks asleep in the bed, they were surprised but gave a sigh of relief when she woke up and ran quickly without looking back. From that day on, Goldilocks learned to never take others' things without asking.</p>
