Once upon a time, a kind girl named Cinderella lived with her cruel stepmother and two jealous stepsisters. After her father died, her stepmother forced Cinderella to work as a servant in her own home, while her stepsisters lived in luxury.

One day, an invitation arrived at their house. The King was holding a grand ball to find a wife for his son, the Prince. All the young ladies in the kingdom were invited.

Cinderella's stepsisters were very excited and spent days preparing for the ball. They ordered Cinderella to help them with their hair and dresses, but they never considered taking her to the ball.

On the night of the ball, after her stepsisters had left, Cinderella sat crying in the garden. Suddenly, her Fairy Godmother appeared.

"Why are you crying, my dear?" asked the Fairy Godmother.

"I want to go to the ball, but I have nothing to wear," Cinderella replied.

The Fairy Godmother waved her magic wand and transformed Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown. She turned a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, and a rat into a coachman. Before Cinderella left, the Fairy Godmother warned her that the magic would end at midnight.

At the ball, Cinderella looked more beautiful than anyone else. The Prince fell in love with her immediately and danced with her all night. As the clock began to strike midnight, Cinderella remembered the warning and rushed away, losing one of her glass slippers as she ran.

The Prince was determined to find the mysterious girl who had captured his heart. He took the glass slipper and visited every house in the kingdom, trying to find the girl whose foot would fit the slipper.

When the Prince arrived at Cinderella's house, her stepsisters tried to force their feet into the slipper, but it was too small for them. Then Cinderella asked if she might try. Her stepsisters laughed at her, but the Prince allowed her to try. The slipper fit perfectly!

The Prince recognized Cinderella as the girl he had danced with at the ball. He asked her to marry him, and they lived happily ever after.
