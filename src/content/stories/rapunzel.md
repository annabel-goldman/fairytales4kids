Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, a couple lived in a small town. The wife was soon pregnant and had strange cravings. She wanted the "Rapunzel" plant growing in an enchanting witch's garden. The husband loved his wife very much, so he decided to steal it.

When he was caught, the witch demanded their baby as payment. When the baby girl was born, the witch took her to a hidden tower in the forest. The witch named the girl Rapunzel after the plant.

Rapunzel grew into a beautiful young woman with long, magical hair which had healing properties. The witch visited Rapunzel by climbing her long, strong hairs. She kept the girl's hair extremely long, never cutting it, and Rapunzel spent her days singing and longing for freedom in her solitude.

One day, a prince was passing by the tower and heard Rapunzel singing. Moved by her beautiful voice, he decided to meet the maiden in the tower. The prince climbed the tower using Rapunzel's hair and they both fell in love.

The prince eventually helped Rapunzel escape, outsmarting the witch. When the witch tried to hurt the prince, Rapunzel healed him with her magical hair. In the end, they both returned to the prince's kingdom, where they lived happily ever after.
