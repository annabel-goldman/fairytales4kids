Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess named Snow White. She was kind and gentle and a friend to all animals.

Snow White's stepmother, the Queen, was jealous of her beauty. The Queen had a magic mirror that would tell her she was the fairest in the land. But one day, the mirror told her that Snow White was now the fairest of them all.

Furious, the Queen ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. But the huntsman couldn't bring himself to harm the kind princess. Instead, he told her to run away and never return to the castle.

Snow White ran deep into the forest, where she discovered a small cottage. Inside, she found seven tiny beds, seven tiny chairs, and seven tiny plates. The cottage belonged to seven dwarfs who worked in a nearby mine.

When the dwarfs returned home, they were surprised to find Snow White asleep in their beds. They welcomed her to stay with them, and she became like a sister to them, keeping their home clean and cooking their meals.

Meanwhile, the Queen discovered that Snow White was still alive. She disguised herself as an old peddler woman and visited the dwarfs' cottage while they were away. She offered Snow White a beautiful red apple, which was poisoned.

As soon as Snow White took a bite of the apple, she fell into a deep sleep. The dwarfs returned to find her lying still and beautiful, as if she were only sleeping. They couldn't bear to bury her, so they placed her in a glass coffin in the forest.

One day, a handsome prince came riding through the forest and saw Snow White in her glass coffin. He was so taken by her beauty that he asked the dwarfs if he could take her to his castle. As they lifted the coffin, the piece of poisoned apple fell from Snow White's lips, and she awoke.

The prince was overjoyed and asked Snow White to marry him. She agreed, and they lived happily ever after in his castle. The wicked Queen, when she heard the news, was so angry that she died of rage.
