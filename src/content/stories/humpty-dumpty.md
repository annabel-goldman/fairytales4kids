Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

He was not just an ordinary egg, oh no! He was an egg with a spirit, full of adventure. This made him climb that tall, towering wall.

But as you know, the wall was awfully high, and it made Humpty feel like he could touch the sky. So up he went without a care, the higher he got, the more he could stare.

However, in his excitement, dear Mr. Dumpty forgot that he was nothing more than a fragile egg. Unlucky for him, he stumbled and lost his balance, resulting in a great fall.

All the king's horses and all the king's men rushed to the spot. They tried their best, but, alas, they couldn't put Humpty together again.

So, children, this tale reminds all to be careful when we play, for we wouldn't want an adventurous day to end in dismay.
