Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, a beautiful princess lived. However, she lost her precious golden ball in a pond while playing one sunny day. The princess was really upset and began to cry.

Out from the water popped a Frog, who offered to retrieve her golden ball. But in return, the Frog asked to be her friend and companion. He wanted to live in the castle, eat at her table, and sleep in her royal bedroom. The princess agreed hastily without any intention to keep her promise.

The Frog, being true to his words, delved deep and swiftly brought back her golden ball. The princess, overwhelmed with joy, grabbed her treasured possession and ran back to the palace, conveniently forgetting about the Frog.

However, the Frog arrived at the castle, reminding her of her promise. Though disgusted by the Frog, the princess honoured her promise due to her father, the King's insistence.

One morning, a magical thing happened. The ugly frog united with his destiny and transformed into a handsome prince. He revealed that he had been under a treacherous witch's curse which could be broken only by a princess who would allow him to eat from her plate and sleep in her bed for three nights.

The Prince and the Princess eventually fell in love, got married and lived happily ever after, reminding us to always be kind, and never judge anyone by their appearances.
